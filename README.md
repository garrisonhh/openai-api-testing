# openai api with requests lib

## how do I use your stupid code

written in python 3.11 with the requests library. if you use nix, this includes a nix flake to ensure version parity.

```bash
# you can omit the key to use the free api, but this is heavily rate limited
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your openai api key>" python ask.py
```
